This repository contains all the ML projects and study materials of a Machine Learning Course by NVIT Chottogram Bangladesh.
Here's what I have learned:
Python Libraries
Machine Learning Tool Sets.
Develop Projects in Jupyter Notebook, Spyder and Various IDE
Difference Between Machine Learning Methods: Supervised and Unsupervised
Supervised learning algorithms, including classification and regression
Unsupervised learning algorithms, including Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
How statistical modeling relates to machine learning and how to compare them
Communicate visually and effectively with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Train/Test cross validation to select correct model and predict model perform with unseen data
Support Vector Machine (SVM) for handwriting recognition and classification
Use decision trees to predict The Scenario
Real-life examples of the different ways machine learning affect society
